.. index:: Creating an Audit

Creating an audit
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Creating an audit is the first step. 

.. note:: Most pages are split into a left panel and a right panel

#. Click on **Create a new Audit** link. This link is on the landing page

    .. note:: The left panel contains all the required fields to start an audit. 

#. Fill all the mandatory fields (see :doc:`audits/audits`)
#. Save the audit (Blue button on right panel)
#. Add the processes, objectives, risks, controls and tests
    #. Click on the 'Add/Modify manually' button

        .. note:: The 'Add/Modify manually' button will only appear after the audit has be saved for the first time.

    #. Add :doc:`audits/process`. You may add any number of processes to an audit. Each process can be expanded using      the '+' right beside the title of the process.
    #. Add :doc:`audits/objective`. When saving the objective, remember to assign a process. You may assign an objective to multiple processes. To see the newly added objective, click on the '+' beside the process to which the objective was assigned.
    #. Add :doc:`audits/risk`. When saving the risk, remember to assign an objective.  You may assign a risk to multiple objectives. To see the newly added risk, click on the '+' beside the objective to which the risk was assigned.
    #. Add :doc:`audits/control`. When saving the control, remember to assign a risk. You may assign a control to multiple risks.  To see the newly added control, click on the '+' beside the risk to which the control was assigned.
    #. Add :doc:`audits/test`. When saving the test, remember to assign a control. You may assign a test to multiple controls. To see the newly added test, click on the '+' beside the control to which the test was assigned.

Managing an audit
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Managing an audit is the ongoing process. Here are the different actions you can do to manage an existing audit:

* Change mandatory fields
* Generate a report
* Change process, objective, risk, control and test
* Attach and delete workpapers

.. warning:: If you delete any object (i.e. an audit, a process, an objective, a risk, a control, or a test), all objects associated with it will also be deleted. For example, if an audit is deleted, all processes, objectives, risks, controls and tests under this audit will also be deleted!
