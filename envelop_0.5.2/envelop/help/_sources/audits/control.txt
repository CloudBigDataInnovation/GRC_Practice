Control
==========

A control may be associated with many risks (many to many relation). When creating a control, it has to be associated to atleast one :doc:`risk`.

Each control can have many :doc:`test` s.

A control has five basic aspects:

* Title
   This field has a maximum of 200 characters.
* Description
   This is a regular text field where there is no limit to the number of characters.
* Control Type
   There is no formal definition of the types of controls in an audit. GRC Envelop uses the two most common types:

   * Key control : these controls are considered the most important controls for which there has to be significant testing
   * Secondary control : these controls are usually provided as extra assurance for key controls. Testing for these controls are not usually significant.

* Risk
   A control has to be associated to atleast one :doc:`risk`.
* Work papers
   Work papers are attachments or file uploads where you can keep files associated to a control.
