.. index:: Executing an Audit

Executing an Audit
==========================

.. note: If the 'Status' is Closed, then you will not be allowed to execute an audit.

.. centered:: The main difference between :doc:`manage-audit` and Executing an Audit is that you can *not* change the content of process, objective, risk, control and test. While executing an audit, you can change test results, test description, and you can create findings.

Views
+++++++++++++

There are five views available while executing an audit:

* **Process**: lists all the processes within the audit. You will have to expand each process to get to its child objects such as objectives.
* **Objective**: lists all the objectives within the audit. You will have to expand each objective to get to its child objects such as risks, controls and tests.
* **Risk**: lists all the risks within the audit. You will have to expand each risk to get to its child objects such as controls and tests.
* **Control**: lists all the controls within the audit. You will have to expand each control to get to its child objects such as tests.
* **Test**: lists all the tests within the audit. You will have to expand each test to get to its child objects such as findings.

Conducting an Audit
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

While you are auditing, select the test you wish to execute. 

* One quick way is to change the view to test and then click on the test you wish, which will bring up the test details on the right hand panel.
* If there are too many tests, then select a higher view, such as control or risk, and then expand the control or risk to find your test.

Once you see the test details appear on the right hand panel, you may enter your test results and test result description. You may also create findings for your tests.

.. note:: Test result is Failed by default.
